The Capibara Critic
================

![Capibara](capibara2.png)

The Capibara Critic is an anonymous but cute animal that points out flaws, incorrectnesses, and missing pieces of information in published machine learning and computer vision articles.

The goal of the Capibara Critic is not to review entire articles, nor is it meant to completely devalue or debunk them. It is rather meant to point out individual issues to help other readers asses articles correctly and compare them fairly with related work. To be entirely clear about this: the fact that an article is listed here doesn't mean that the entire article is of low quality or that it isn't a valuable read.
